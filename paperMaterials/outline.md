# Modeling the DVM of Mysis
-


## Abstract:

## Introduction:
- Research into specific aspects of mysis dvm has been done before, none looking at it from such a pulled back view. 
- Sampling is expensive, time consuming and inconvenient..
- ...Modeling is not. 
- Modeling is not perfect, but captures the underlying patterns well enough to drive further research into those specific aspects of DVM. 


## Methods:
- Coded in R
- Agent Based
- Built on models, but with room for real data
	- Equations of the models
- Made into shiny app to allow for interactivity 

## Results:

- Small perturbations in conditions such as ___ resulted in chaotic behavior. 

## Conclusions:

- The sensitive dependence upon initial conditions implies high sensitivity to environmental changes. 


# Model To-Do's

- Tie the reward value to the time of the year.
