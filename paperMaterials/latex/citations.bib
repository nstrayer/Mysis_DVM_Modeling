@article{lightPaper,
	Abstract = {{The depth selection behaviors of juvenile mysids, Mysis diluviana,
   exposed to different temperature and light gradients in the laboratory
   were compared to those observed in previous studies on adult mysids to
   determine whether mysid light and temperature preferences have an
   ontogenetic component. Juvenile mysids most strongly preferred 11
   degrees C, which is 5 degrees C higher than those most preferred by
   adults, but both size classes completely avoided temperatures of 16
   degrees C and greater. Juveniles and adults preferred light levels
   between 10(-5) and 10(-6) lx, or similar to 10(-7) and 10(-8)
   ``mylux{''} - a unit of brightness specific for mysid vision; however,
   juveniles did not display avoidance behaviors until 10(-0.6) mylux (-44
   lx), compared to adults which avoid light levels of 10(-3) mylux, or
   similar to 0.1 lx, and above. Because the differences in preferences
   between juveniles and adults were more pronounced in relation to
   temperature than to light, we expect stronger vertical separation of
   mysid size classes during periods of the year when the water column is
   thermally stratified versus isothermal. We present limited field data
   and review past literature to support this hypothesis, as juvenile
   mysids are typically found higher in the water column than adults,
   especially during periods of the year when the water column is thermally
   stratified. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that
   ontogenetic differences in light and temperature preferences lead to
   habitat partitioning in a mysid species and highlights the often
   underreported importance of juvenile mysids to food web structure and
   function in open waters above the thermocline. (C) 2010 International

@article{lunarCycle,
	Abstract = {{We measured downwelling spectral vector irradiance (from 350 to 800 nm)
   during evening civil and nautical twilight (solar elevation down to -12
   degrees). Nine sets of measurements were taken to cover the first half
   of the lunar cycle (from the new to full moon) and were also used to
   calculate chromaticity (CIE 1976 u'v'). The lunar phase had no
   consistent effect on downwelling irradiance until solar elevation was
   less than -8 degrees. For lower solar elevations, the effect of the moon
   increased with the fraction of the illuminated lunar disk until the
   fraction was approximately 50\%. For fractions greater than 50\%, the
   brightness and chromaticity of the downwelling irradiance were
   approximately independent of the fraction illuminated, likely because
   the greater brightness of a fuller moon was offset by its lower
   elevation during twilight. Given the importance of crepuscular periods
   to animal activity, including predation, reproductive cycles, and color
   vision in dim light, these results may have significant implications for
   animal ecology. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

@article{algaeBlooms,
	Abstract = {{This study developed satellite remote sensing models to detect
   cyanobacterial blooms via chlorophyll a in Lake Champlain. Landsat
   Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data was used to retrieve chlorophyll a
   concentrations, phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria biovolume by
   calibrating and validating with coincident observation data. Correlation
   analysis results showed that band 2 (green band) and the band ratio of
   2/1 (green/blue) were most highly correlated to chlorophyll a
   concentration (r = 0.76 and 0.82, respectively). Multiple regression
   results identified band 2 and 3 (red), and band ratio of 2/1 and 3/1
   (red/blue) as critical information to estimate chlorophyll a
   concentrations. The regression models accounted for 72 to 83\% of the
   variability in chlorophyll a observations, allowing for estimates of
   phytoplankton and cyanobacteria levels in the lake. Satellite image
   processing results successfully showed the temporal and spatial
   distribution of chlorophyll a, phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria in the
   lake. This information can be used to evaluate the effect of pollution
   sources and weather conditions, and assist decision making for water
   management.}},
