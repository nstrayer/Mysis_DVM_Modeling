Temperature and distance. 

Temperature dependent expressive mechanism. 


Treat light response just like we are treating light intensity. Using Beerâ€™s Law to calculate a given point of intensity. 

Potentially look at female reproductive stage. 

Figure out light an temp thresholds through whole year. 

Just get the model to be where the mysis gets to based upon lowest light or temp profile. 

Mysis start migrating at sundown and go back at sunrise. 

__Next steps:__

- Import the real light data. 
- Probability of migrating goes from .9 to .1 from summer to winter. 
- 

distributions of food potential vary seasonally. 
e.g.
- mean is higher in summer
- spring has higher deviation
