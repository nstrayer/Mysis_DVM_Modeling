```{r}

# Code for a simple food availability model based upon the assumptions of higher pelagic food quality
# in the summer. 
```

## Parameters We Set: 

```{r}
#First we set up some user defined variables. 
min     = 0.15 #minimum food availability value
max     = 0.97 #max 
highDay = 210*24 #Number of days into the year that the max food availability is (226 is aug 15)
august  = 5856 #hours into the year
```

## The actual model

```{r}
#Now we generate the others
scaler    = (max - min)/2 #range divided by two
heightAdj = (max + min)/2 #average value
hours      = 1:(365*24) #Set up a hour vector to loop over
foodAvail = NULL  

#Quick loop to generate the data. 
for (hour in hours){
  foodAvail = c(foodAvail, scaler * cos( (1/(365*24))*2*pi * (hour - highDay)) + heightAdj)
}

plot(hours,foodAvail, type = "l")
```

## The variability curve

Here we set up another curve which represents the variablity of the food distribution at any time. 

The value of the curve $f(hour) =$ variability of distribution. 


```{r}
min     = 0.01 #minimum food availability value
max     = 0.12 #max 
highDay = 100*24
scaler    = (max - min)/2 #range divided by two
heightAdj = (max + min)/2 #average value
variability = NULL

#Quick loop to generate the data. 
for (hour in hours){
  variability = c(variability, scaler * cos( (1/(365*24))*4*pi * (hour - highDay)) + heightAdj)
}

plot(hours,variability, type = "l")

avail_var_df = as.data.frame(cbind(foodAvail, variability))
```

## Combined curves:

We will now generate the bounding curves by adding and subtracting the variablity from the main curve. 

```{r}
highBound = NULL
lowBound  = NULL

for (hour in hours){
  highBound = c(highBound, (foodAvail[hour] + variability[hour]))  
  lowBound = c(lowBound, (foodAvail[hour] - variability[hour]))
}

distributionDf = as.data.frame(cbind(hours, highBound, lowBound))

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(distributionDf, aes(hours)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = highBound, colour = "#beaed4")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = lowBound, colour = "#7fc97f")) 

```

## Save to file 
```{r}
setwd("/Users/Nick/mysisModeling")
#write.csv(distributionDf, "data/FoodAvail_Hour.csv", row.names=FALSE) #The bounded model  
write.csv(avail_var_df, "data/FoodAvail_Hour.csv", row.names=FALSE) #The plain side curve. 

```
